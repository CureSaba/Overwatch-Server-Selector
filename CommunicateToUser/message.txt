Hi

Im aware of the problems some of you have been experiencing with the app. Due to personal constraints, I no longer have the time and energy to support or update it. While the app may still work in part, some major features might not function properly.

I encourage the community to contribute and keep the project alive, but I wont be able to manage it alone anymore. Thank you for your understanding and support.
